# Comparison of Python with Gensim and PySpark with PySpark-ML for Topic Modeling with the LDA Algorithm

This repository contains code and data to compare the performance of Python with the Gensim library and PySpark with the PySpark-ML library for topic modeling with the LDA algorithm. The focus is on tracking scalability and parallelisation of the two approaches.
